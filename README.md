# Simple-TicTacToe
## Concept
This implementation of TicTacToe in python uses the concept of placing numbers in a 3x3 grid. The first person playing can place odd numbers and the second person playing can place even numbers. The first person to make the sum of a row, column or diagonal 15 wins. In case the board gets filled and none of the players have achieved a sum of 15 in a row, column or diagonal, the game is declared a tie.
## Execution
To play, clone the repository on your device, navigate to the folder, and execute:

```
python3 ttt_oddeven.py
```
  
## Further Plans
- Make normal TicTacToe using X and O
- Better Error Handling
